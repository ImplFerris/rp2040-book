# B Equation

The B equation, also called the Beta parameter method, is the simplest way to convert thermistor resistance into temperature. It uses a single material constant provided by the manufacturer to approximate the thermistor's behavior.

## The B equation formula

\\[
\frac{1}{T} = \frac{1}{T_0} + \frac{1}{B} \ln \left( \frac{R}{R_0} \right)
\\]

In this equation, T is the temperature in Kelvin that we want to find. R is the measured resistance at the unknown temperature T.

\\( T_0 \\) is the reference temperature, usually 298.15K (25°C), where the thermistor's resistance is known.  \\( R_0 \\) is the resistance at the reference temperature \\( T_0 \\), often 10kΩ for common thermistors. 

B is the B-value of the thermistor, a material constant. And, the ln represents the natural logarithm function.

### Understanding the parameters

**R₀ (Reference resistance)**:

This is the thermistor's resistance at a known temperature, usually 25°C. For example, a "10kΩ thermistor" has R₀ = 10,000 ohms at 25°C. This value should be specified in the datasheet.

**B (Beta value)**:

The B value is a constant usually provided by the manufacturers. The value describes how quickly resistance changes with temperature. Common values range from 3000 to 4000 K.

The datasheet often specifies B over a temperature range, such as B₂₅/₈₅ = 3950, meaning the Beta value is 3950 between 25°C and 85°C.

**Temperature in Kelvin**:

The temperature in the B equation must be in Kelvin (Kelvin = Celsius + 273.15), not Celsius. Convert to Kelvin before using the equation, and subtract 273.15 from the result to get Celsius again.

## Example Calculation

Let us say the measured resistance of the thermistor is 10,475 Ω, which corresponds to R in the equation. To calculate the temperature, we substitute this value along with the reference temperature \\( T_0 = 298.15K \\) (25°C), the reference resistance \\( R_0 = 10k\Omega \\), and the thermistor B-value of 3950 into the B equation.

**Step 1**: Calculate the resistance ratio
\\[
\frac{R}{R_0} = \frac{10475}{10000} = 1.0475
\\]

**Step 2**: Calculate the natural logarithm of the ratio
\\[
\ln(1.0475) = 0.04641
\\]

**Step 3**: Apply the B equation
\\[
\frac{1}{T} = \frac{1}{298.15} + \frac{1}{3950} \times 0.04641
\\]

\\[
\frac{1}{T} = 0.003354 + 0.00001175 = 0.003366
\\]

**Step 4**: Calculate T by taking the reciprocal
\\[
T = \frac{1}{0.003366} = 297.1K
\\]

**Step 5**: Convert to Celsius
\\[
T = 297.1 - 273.15 = 23.95°C
\\]

The measured resistance of 10,475Ω corresponds to a temperature of approximately 24°C.

}

const B_VALUE: f64 = 3950.0;
const V_IN: f64 = 3.3; // Input voltage
const REF_RES: f64 = 10_000.0; // Reference resistance in ohms (10kΩ)
const REF_TEMP: f64 = 25.0;  // Reference temperature 25°C

fn main() {
    let t0 = celsius_to_kelvin(REF_TEMP);
    let r = 10475.0; // Measured resistance in ohms
    
    let temperature_kelvin = calculate_temperature(r, REF_RES, t0, B_VALUE);
    let temperature_celsius = kelvin_to_celsius(temperature_kelvin);
    println!("Temperature: {:.2} °C", temperature_celsius);
}
