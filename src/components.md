# Components

In this book, we will use various external components together with the Pico to build examples and experiments. These components are used to interact with the outside world, such as reading inputs, controlling outputs, and displaying information.

Some components are simple parts like LEDs, buttons, resistors, LDRs, and thermistors. Others are assembled units such as displays, sensors, and interface devices that connect to the Pico using a small number of pins.

> [!Important]
> Some components may require soldering, for example attaching header pins to boards such as displays or sensor modules. Many parts are also available in pre-soldered form.
>
> If a component does not have pins attached, you will need to solder them before use. Soldering is a practical skill in embedded work, so take your time and follow basic safety precautions.

This section only provides an overview of the components that appear throughout the book. Detailed explanations, wiring, and code examples are covered later in their respective chapters. You do not need to collect all components in advance. You can add them gradually as you progress through the book.
