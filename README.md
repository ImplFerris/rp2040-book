# impl Rust for Pico - Intro

In this book, we use the Raspberry Pi Pico and program it in Rust to explore various exciting projects. You will work on exercises like dimming an LED, controlling a servo motor, measuring distance with a sonic sensor, displaying the Ferris (🦀) image on an OLED display, using an RFID reader, playing songs on a buzzer, turning on an LED when the room light is off, measuring temperature, and much more.

## Meet the hardware - Pico

We will be using the Raspberry Pi Pico, which is part of the Raspberry Pi Pico series built around the RP2040 microcontroller. The RP2040 is designed by Raspberry Pi in the UK and features a dual-core Arm Cortex-M0+ processor with 264 KB of on-chip SRAM and support for external flash memory. You find more details from the [official website](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/).
